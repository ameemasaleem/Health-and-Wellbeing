    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to Health & Wellbeing! We're here to provide you with practical tips and resources to help you live a healthier, happier life.Mental health is an essential component of an individual’s overall health. According to the World Health Organization, health is the state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being that transcends the absence of diseases or infirmity. </p>
  </section>
  <section id="what is the difference between health and wellbeing?">
  <h2>What is the difference between Health and Wellbeing?</h2>
  <p>Health is the state of being free from injury or illness. Physical health means living in a body free of disease, while mental health refers to the strength and resilience of your mental functions. Well-being is the absence of “negative” things, like mental distress and physical illness, and can affect your quality of life.</p>

  <p>Science recognizes two types of well-being: objective and subjective.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="objective wellbeing">
    <h3>Objective Wellbeing:</h3>
    <p>This metric reflects our basic human needs. These include food, education, health care services, safety, and shelter. Objective <b>well-being rises and drops</b> with social, cultural, and political events. Gauging well-being involves asking people to self-report the factors of well-being listed above. </p>
  </section>
  <section id="subjective wellbeing">
    <h3>Subjective Wellbeing:</h3>
    <p>This measures our perception and our <b> experiential well-being </b>. Gauging <b> subjective well-being </b> means asking people how they feel about their well-being. It relies on less tangible metrics like life satisfaction, social experience, and happiness.</p>

  <h2>Dimensions of Wellbeing</h2>

<div class="Dimensions of wellbeing">

<h4> Phyical Health:</h4>
<p>Physical health is a state of bodily well-being. You are free from illness, injury, or invisible illness like pain. You enjoy optimal functioning, strength, endurance, and general vitality.</p>
</div>

</section>
<section class="dimensions-of-wellbeing">
<img src="image.jpg/Mental Health.gif" alt="wellbeing" class="Mentalhealth">

<div class="Dimensions of wellbeing">

<h4> Mental Health:</h4>
<p>Mental health is your emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. It can impact your ability to make enough money to live comfortably, forge friendships, and reach goals. Mental health awareness is vital for personal functioning, social experience, and coping with chronic stress.</p>
</div>
</section>

</section>
<section class="dimensions-of-wellbeing">
<img src="image.jpg/Social Health.gif" alt="wellbeing" class="Socialhealth">

<div class="Dimensions of wellbeing">

<h4> Social Health:</h4>
<p>Social health is how well you interact and connect with others. Strong social health fosters strong relationships. It gives you a feeling of belonging and support within a community or workplace. Particular communities and groups may face more mental health challenges depending on their location or community experiences.</p>
</div>
</section>

<section class="dimensions-of-wellbeing">
  <img src="image.jpg/Environmental Health.gif" alt="wellbeing" class="Environmentalhealth">
  
  <div class="Dimensions of wellbeing">
  
  <h4> Environmental Health:</h4>
  <p>Environmental health focuses on the conditions and factors around you. Environmental factors include air and water quality, safe housing, and radiation protection.</p>
  </div>
  </section>

  <section class="dimensions-of-wellbeing">
    <img src="image.jpg/Occupational Health.gif" alt="wellbeing" class="Occupationalhealth">
    
    <div class="Dimensions of wellbeing">
    
    <h4> Occupational Health:</h4>
    <p>Occupational health focuses on preventing workplace illnesses and injuries. It requires safe work environments, freedom from hazards, and a sense of security and psychological safety. Beyond individual occupational health, poor mental health support often affects teams (although poor well-being isn’t contagious.)</p>
    </div>
    </section>

    <section class="dimensions-of-wellbeing">
      <img src="image.jpg/Spiritual Health.gif" alt="wellbeing" class="Spiritualhealth">
      
      <div class="Dimensions of wellbeing">
      
      <h4> Spiritual Health:</h4>
      <p>Spiritual health means possessing a sense of meaning, purpose, and connection. It may present as inner peace, resilience, compassion (including self-compassion), or internal harmony. For some, it may involve religion but can also arise from a human connection and harmony with the world around you.</p>
      </div>
      </section>

      <section id="how are health and wellbeing connected?">
        <img src="image.jpg/Health and wellbeing connected.gif"alt="wellbeing"class="Healthandwellbeingconnected">
        <h2>How are Health and Wellbeing Connected?</h2>
        <p>There’s a direct link between your well-being and your physical health. Poor mental health and physical well-being impact the ability to fight off disease and make healthy choices. When your well-being starts to suffer, your physical health declines as well. Good mental health can boost immunity and lower inflammatory response.

          It’s more difficult to perform well or stay healthy when your well-being is lacking. Health and well-being are interdependent states. When one falters, the other may be in jeopardy. </p>

            <td>Taking care of your well-being can have a positive impact on your health. You may want to incorporate mindfulness, meditation, and techniques like journaling or practicing gratitude to alter the perception of stress and depression. Taking care of your well-being isn’t just about feeling better in the moment. It can offer long-term benefits to your body.

            </td>
            <td>Physical health informs your perception of well-being. A healthy body can enhance your quality of life. It can also enable you to participate in activities that boost your mood. For instance, routine exercise boosts endorphin levels. This can improve mood, reduce stress, and ease symptoms of depression and anxiety. It can also help build emotional regulation skills. Healthy people often sleep better, move more, and achieve their goals.</td>

            <td>
              Just like well-being impacts health, mental health has very real and far-reaching impacts on physical health. Good mental health, in turn, is a key component of good physical health. When people experience excessive stress, it increases the risk of developing depression. Experiencing depressive symptoms can significantly decrease a person’s well-being and physical health. 
              However, taking care of physical health can help you boost mental health outcomes:
<ul class="custom-list"></ul>
<li>Healthy lifestyles may prevent or alleviate mental health conditions, including depression and anxiety
Healthy</li> 
<li>lifestyles can improve mental health for those living with depression and anxiety.</li>
</ul>
</td>
<td>Both physical and mental health impact well-being. When people feel mentally fit and balanced, they’re more resilient and able to bounce back. 

  Likewise, both objective and subjective well-being affect mental health. 
  
  When basic needs such as shelter, food, and freedom are met, you tend to be happier, feel less stressed, and be more present. This illustrates how comprehensive well-being promotes good mental health.</td>

<h2>The effects of stress on health and wellbeing</h2>


<p>Stress is a global health issue. It affects most people, even young people. Chronic stress bleeds into every aspect of our lives and occupies our thoughts. It can make it harder to lead healthy lives, spurring substance abuse, increasing chronic disease, and reducing overall health.</p>
<br>
<p>While stress can come from many places, work is a common culprit. Recent data shows 64% of workers experience frequent stress on the job. </p>
<br>
<p>Stressed, frustrated employees are 37% more frequently absent from work, 18% less productive, and 15% less profitable than their counterparts.</p>
<br>
<p>Examples of stressed workers include delivery drivers, warehouse workers, and programmers sleeping under their desks. They’re working longer hours due to high demand or company goals and policies. The result is excessive stress. The trend increases injury and exhaustion rates, damaging employee health. </p>
<br>
<p>
  Over 90% of American workers report experiencing “extreme stress” at their jobs. Excessive stress makes it harder to “leave work at work,” decreasing well-being.  
</p>
<br>
<p>
  Some companies respond to these complaints with a renewed commitment to employee wellness. However, the larger issues of the modern workplace persist.

<h2>Ways to improve your health and wellbeing</h2>

<section class="ways to improve your Health and Wellbeing">
  <img src="image.jpg/connect with others.gif" alt="wellbeing" class="Connectwithothers">
  
  <div class="ways to improve your Health and Wellbeing">
  
  <h4> Connect with others:</h4>
  <p>Relationships with other people are critical to our well-being and mental health, and for good reason. Humans are social creatures. We evolved to live in tight-knit groups of other people. In evolutionary terms, our survival depended on it. 
  <br>
 Though society has evolved, our well-being still depends on connecting with others. Meaningful relationships enhance our sense of purpose, and time with others promotes healthy behaviors. 
 Here are a few ways to connect, even from a distance:
 <br>

 <strong>on a FaceTime or Zoom call with a friend or loved one.</strong>
 <br>
 <strong>Carve out quality time with your partner, housemates, kids, or whoever else you share a home with.</strong>
 <br>
 <strong>Strengthen your connections by getting to know your neighbors.</strong>
 <br>
 <strong>Send a text message to let a friend know you’re thinking of them.</strong>
 <br>
 <strong>Start an online book club or find a new hobby with a group.</strong>
 <br>
 <strong>outside for a walk with a good friend or loved one.</strong>

    <div class="ways to improve your Health and Wellbeing">
    
    <h4> Be physically active:</h4>
    <p>Exercise can improve sleep, boost your mood, and decrease anxiety, depression, and stress. 

      Studies show that physical activity may help moderate depression as effectively as antidepressant medications.  
      
      If you want to reap the benefits of exercise for well-being, you can start small. A recent review associated exercise with a decrease in mental health issues and an increase in beneficial effects like improved sleep.</p>

      <section class="ways to improve your Health and Wellbeing">
        <img src="image.jpg/learn new skills.gif" alt="wellbeing" class="learnnewskills">
        
        <div class="ways to improve your Health and Wellbeing">
        
        <h4> Learn new skills:</h4>
        <p>Learning is more than a positive way to spend your free time. It’s also an excellent way to maintain your well-being. 

        Research shows that learning improves confidence and self-esteem. It promotes purpose, helps build connections with others, and may slow cognitive aging.
          
        With that in mind, get out there and learn something new. Use a language app to learn a language. Sign up for a class at a local university. Audit a course. Listen to mental health podcasts or wellness content. It’s fun and good for your well-being.  </p>

            <h4> Give to others:</h4>
            <p>Generosity feels great regardless, but it can also improve your well-being.

              If you’re looking for a way to give back, start with your community. Research community organizations that support causes you’re interested in. Donate money or time to a local food bank or shelter. 
              
              There are thousands of ways to be charitable, so you can find a cause that aligns with your interests.  </p>

                <h4> Pay attention to the present:</h4>
                <p>Most of us have experienced firsthand how stressful it is to live with our minds dwelling in the past or worrying about the future. When we live in the past, we get caught up in shame, anger, and regret.

                  When we’re focused on the future, it’s easy to dwell and stoke anxiety and anticipation about what will come.
                  
                  Mindfulness can center your attention in the here and now. The Mayo Clinic defines it as being intensely aware of what you’re sensing without interpretation or judgment.
                  
                  Practicing mindfulness helps you spend more time in the world around you as it is, not as you hope or fear it will be. Over time, mindfulness can promote many health and well-being benefits, including:
                  
                  Reduced stress,
                  Less anxiety and depression,
                  Better mood and outlook
                  More focus
                  If you want to incorporate more mindfulness into your daily life, you can get help from a mobile app. You can do breathing exercises, walking meditation, exercise like yoga, or other practices to keep you grounded.</p>

  <h4> Improve sleep quality:</h4>
  <p>Living on six hours of sleep might be possible, but it’s not helpful to your well-being or mental health journey. Increasing the duration and quality of sleep can lower your heart rate, blood pressure, and stress.

    Make sleep hygiene a focus of your day. Wind down from screens early (two hours before bed, ideally). Create a wind-down ritual that works for you. It might be meditation, a hot bath, or quiet reading time. Whatever it is, prepare your mind and your environment for a great night’s sleep.</p>

    <h4> Eat nutritious food:</h4>
    <p>Our bodies need the proper nutritional balance to thrive. Take the time to plan your meals to include the right components for a healthy diet. Limit refined sugars, alcohol, and caffeine, since they affect health factors like sleep.

    Pay attention to what your body doesn't want as well. For instance, avoid foods that cause ill effects or inflammation. For instance, if you have gut issues, experiment with removing dairy or gluten to see if you notice a change. Identifying food triggers can improve your health and your mental wellness.</p>

      <h4> Spend time outside:</h4>
      <p>The health and happiness effects of nature are far-reaching. Spending time in the sunshine, on the ocean, or just getting fresh air helps you reset and find your center. Nature also offers a healthy break from our technology-heavy world.

        Find places that inspire and calm you. Schedule those visits, or take some time to enjoy them when life seems heavy. Doing so has long-lasting health and wellness benefits. Wellness coaching can help you better embrace them all.</p>
